# ERC20Token_bonusfeature


Hello this is a basic solidity smart contract I've written for my internship application at W3Dev.
I wanted to play around with the [block.timestamp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-anatomy) feature so I created a functions that gives bonus tokens 
to people who have already recieved the ERC20 tokens already and they'll receive bonus exactly after 1 minute of deploying the contract. This timeframe was just for testing but we can keep different time as well.
Maybe this can be a smart contract that can send bonuses on Diwali :firecracker: :firecracker: or Christmas :christmas_tree:
